# RDSDataObjects
This app allows images to be copied to an app running on a Remote Desktop application, for insertion as an image into a picturebox, from an image file on a local file system.

Nothing needs installing on the local PC.

This project is based on David Ewen's very good project "Outlook Drag and Drop in C#" in CodeProject, with a few tweaks to get it working for my requirements.
